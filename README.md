# KGstat

This repository includes tutorial notebooks that combine querying Knowlege Graphs using SPARQL and applying statistical analysis and modeling using R as a programming language.


In these tutorials, we demonstrate:
- accessing and querying the knowledge graphs 
- visualizing descriptive statistics
- regression methods
- classification methods
- time series analysis

The intended audience is data science students as well as the Semantic Web community and Statisticians to discover how they can benefit from each other's work.
